# Neural Network Dataset
The original version of this dataset was created by <strong>Arash Torabi Goodarzi, Roman Kochnev</strong> and <strong>Zofia Antonina Bentyn</strong> at the Computer Vision Laboratory, University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

## Contribution

To add more neural network models to the dataset, the following criteria must be met:
1. The code for each model must be provided in a respective ".py" file for the model in the directory <strong>/ab/nn/dataset</strong>. This file must be named after the name of the model structure.
2. The main class for each model must be named <strong>Net</strong>.
3. The implementation of this <strong>Net</strong> class must provide non-mutable default parameters for its constructor.

For examples, see the models in the <strong>/ab/nn/dataset</strong> directory.
